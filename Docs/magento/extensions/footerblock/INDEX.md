Introduction
-----

![][demo]

The FooterBlock module overrides the default Magento footer with one configurable from the admin. It adds in three list columns and one text box (for disclaimers etc), in addition to styling the footer menu.

The 3 list columns can be configured from the admin to show a variety of different product lists. From the admin you can decide how many products to include in the lists, whether or not to truncate the titles, and whether to display them randomly or by catalog order (this only applies to Featured Products). 

Each column has its own configuration section. First, you can choose which product list to show. You can choose from: **Best-Selling**, **Featured Products**, **Recently Added**, **Most Viewed**, and **Highest Rated**. You also have the option of choosing **Custom Text** (input below) which allows you to add your own content in the space provided.

>> NOTE:  If you wish to use dynamically updating lists (﻿Best-Selling, Recently Added, Most Viewed, & Highest Rated﻿)﻿ you will need to disable the cache for **Blocks HTML output** by going to **System -> Cache Management** in the admin. If not, the lists won't be updated and the cached version will be displayed. 

Setup
-----

RokMage Modules can be managed via the configuration interface accessible by navigating to **Admin -> System -> Configuration** and clicking on the corresponding extension in the sidebar under **RokMage Modules**. 

You will want to make sure that the **Configuration Scope** is set to the theme you wish to modify the settings unless you wish to change the default for all scopes.

How to Install
-----

You can download a zip package from the RokMage Extensions using the **Download** button above..

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the extension package, you will notice that the folder structure for the files has been included. This means you can simply copy the files/folders over to the corresponding folder of your Magento site, if developing locally. 

If you are developing on a remote server, you can simply upload the **app** and **skin** folders to the Magento install on your server.

![][installation]

:	1. This can also be the name of your template package. [22%, 55%, sw]
	2. This can also be the name of your template package. [77%, 50%, sw]

Magento uses a hierarchy system. Adding the files in the **base** folder will work with any theme package. You can also elect to add the layout, template, and skin files to your theme package folder (instead of base) in order to have the extension apply only to that theme. Anything placed in the theme package folder will override what exists in the **base** folder. Anything in the **base** folder is accepted as default.

>> If you download a RocketTheme Magento template, the extension files will all be included in the theme package folder, not the base folder.
