-----
[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme template. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Joomla.

What is Fusion Menu?

Fusion Menu is a menu theme of the RokNavMenu extension, the addon that drives many RocketTheme template menus. It is primarily a javascript enhanced CSS dropdown menu, that combines standard suckerfish type functionality with animations, transitions and other advanced effects provided by Mootools.

What is Splitmenu?
-----
A static menu system that displays 1st level items in the main horizontal menu and further children in the Sidebar.

What extensions are integrated with the template?
-----
A few of our RocketTheme extensions have been given individual styling by the template, these are RokGallery and RokNavMenu.

Can I install RocketLauncher on existing Joomla! website?
-----
No. RocketLauncher will install both Joomla and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Joomla! installation.

I installed Momentum RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.
-----
To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
