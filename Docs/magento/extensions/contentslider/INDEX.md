Introduction
-----

![][demo]

The ContentSlider module adds a content slider to the hompage and category pages. Both sliders can be fully configured from the admin section. The first section has settings that apply to both sliders. You can choose whether or not to enable Autoplay, whether to show the 'previous' and 'next' arrows, and also set the duration that each slide will display for.

Both sliders are identical, however, the homepage slider has the option of showing custom content as well as catalog products. If you choose to show catalog products, you have the following options available. First, you can choose how to filter the products that will be shown (choosing between *Select Specific Products From List Below, Show All Products, Featured Products, Best Selling Products, Recently Added Products, Most Viewed Products, & Highest Rated Products*).

>> NOTE:  If you wish to use dynamically updating lists (﻿*Best-Selling, Recently Added, Most Viewed, & Highest Rated﻿*)﻿ you will need to disable the cache for **Blocks HTML output** by going to **System -> Cache Management** in the admin. If not, the lists won't be updated, and the cached version will be displayed. 

If you choose to **Select Specific Products From List Below**, you can use the multi-select list to choose which products to show. Simply click the products in the list while holding **CTRL (or CMD if using a Mac)**. You can also choose to truncate titles and descriptions, as well as whether to randomize the products, or show them in the catalog order.

If you choose to show custom content, you can go to the **Homepage slides** section at the bottom. Each slide has its own section, where you can specify a title, the text for the content, an image to show, the text for the button link, and the URL that the button will redirect to.

>> NOTE: You only need to add the final portion of the URL, after **index.php/**. For example: **microsoft-wireless-optical-mouse-5000.html**.

Setup

How to Install
-----

You can download a zip package from the RokMage Extensions using the **Download** button above..

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the extension package, you will notice that the folder structure for the files has been included. This means you can simply copy the files/folders over to the corresponding folder of your Magento site, if developing locally. 

If you are developing on a remote server, you can simply upload the **app** and **skin** folders to the Magento install on your server.

![][installation]

:	1. This can also be the name of your template package. [22%, 55%, sw]
	2. This can also be the name of your template package. [77%, 50%, sw]

Magento uses a hierarchy system. Adding the files in the **base** folder will work with any theme package. You can also elect to add the layout, template, and skin files to your theme package folder (instead of base) in order to have the extension apply only to that theme. Anything placed in the theme package folder will override what exists in the **base** folder. Anything in the **base** folder is accepted as default.

>> If you download a RocketTheme Magento template, the extension files will all be included in the theme package folder, not the base folder.
