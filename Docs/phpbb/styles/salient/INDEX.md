Integrated styling is provided for extensions in its various layout types, such as Tabs and Headlines. Salient is based on the RokBB Framework, and has varying other features available.

>> NOTE: Because Salient is based on a Gantry 5 Joomla template, it is not compatible with RokNavMenu Exporter. This is due to the fact that Gantry 5 does not use RokNavMenu as it has its own built-in menu system. A solution for fans of this exporter is currently in progress.
