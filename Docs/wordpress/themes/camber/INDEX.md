There are two menu options, SplitMenu and Fusion Menu. The Splitmenu is a static menu system that displays select menu items in a main horizontal menu. The Fusion Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options.

### Compact Login

A uniquely styled feature of Camber, is the horizontal login in the header area. The styling is automatically applied, without the need for an additional widget suffix, which transforms the vertical login into a singular-lined login, perfect for displaying in space-conscious zones.
