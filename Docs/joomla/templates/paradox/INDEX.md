![][scrollingmodules]

Scrolling Positions is a Gantry feature, which, when activated, modifies the behaviour of stacked modules. Instead of appearing vertically, the other modules become accessible via a button for the Top, Showcase, Feature or Bottom Module rows.

### Triple SplitMenu

![][splitmenu]

There are two menu options, Triple Level SplitMenu and Fusion. Triple Level Splitmenu splits the first level, second level and all further menu items, allowing for for a navigation bar, a dropline and a sidemenu, as configurable.
