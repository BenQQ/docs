Introduction
-----

Ethereal is an exquisitely designed style, bursting with elegance, sharpness and bold, but complementary visuals; achieved via a subtle color scheme with dashes of vibrancy, within a rich framework of emphasized typography and iconography.

Integrated styling is provided for extensions in its various layout types, such as Tabs and Headlines. Ethereal is based on the RokBB Framework, and has varying other features available.

>> NOTE: Because Ethereal is based on a Gantry 5 Joomla template, it is not compatible with RokNavMenu Exporter. This is due to the fact that Gantry 5 does not use RokNavMenu as it has its own built-in menu system.
