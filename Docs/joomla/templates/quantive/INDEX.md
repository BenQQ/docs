Introduction
-----

Quantive encapsulates the notion of simply complex, featuring a conservative design. Stylistic choice is another key aspect, with its 8 CSS style choices, each of which can be either light or dark body styling, as noted in the 10 presets, providing choice and flexibility.

### Popup Login

![][login]

The login module is an important element of any site. Nevertheless, it can be a bulky presence on a page, especially if you are conscious of screen space. Modulus uses a popup login powered by RokBox, which is activated by a single button in the menu bar, to alleviate this.

### Triple SplitMenu

![][tsm]

There are two menu options, Triple Level SplitMenu and Fusion. The latter is a CSS based dropdown menu. Triple Level Splitmenu splits the first level, second level and all further menu items, allowing for for a navigation bar, a dropline and a sidemenu, as configurable.
