This area of the front page is an article. Articles appear within the **Mainbody** area of the front page.

Turning on Mainbody Content
-----

This content appears on the front page because the **Mainbody Enabled** option has been turned on in the template settings. You can find these settings by navigating to **Administrator -> Extensions -> Templates Manager -> Reflex -> Advanced**.

![][advanced]

Once this is done, you can navigate to the **Menu Manager** by going to **Administrator -> Menus -> Menu Manager**. From here, you'll want to find the menu item for your home page and select it so you can access its settings. For our demo, it is located in **Main Menu -> Home**.

![][menu]

:   1. **Intro Articles** [35%, 72%, se]
    2. **Article Order** [51%, 72%, se]

In order to show two featured articles on the front page, we placed a `1` in the **Intro Articles** setting within the **Layout Options** menu. The **Article Order** has been set to **Featured Articles Order**. We also turned **Linked Titles** off in the **Article Options** menu.

The **Introducing Reflex with RokGallery** article is a standard article with the **Featured** option turned on so it appears in the front page mainbody.
