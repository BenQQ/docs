## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing WordPress! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both WordPress and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh WordPress! installation.

## I installed Topaz RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
