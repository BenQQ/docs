Introduction
-----

![][demo]

The ModalHeader module adds in some extra functionality to the header section of a Magento store. It connects the "Log In" link to a modal login form, and adds a text-resizer. It adds a modal shopping cart viewer, and adds styling to the search form and breadcrumbs. The modal window animation parameters can be tweaked from the admin config.

Setup
-----

RokMage Modules can be managed via the configuration interface accessible by navigating to **Admin -> System -> Configuration** and clicking on the corresponding extension in the sidebar under **RokMage Modules**. 

You will want to make sure that the **Configuration Scope** is set to the theme you wish to modify the settings unless you wish to change the default for all scopes.

How to Install
-----

You can download a zip package from the RokMage Extensions using the **Download** button above..

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the extension package, you will notice that the folder structure for the files has been included. This means you can simply copy the files/folders over to the corresponding folder of your Magento site, if developing locally. 

If you are developing on a remote server, you can simply upload the **app** and **skin** folders to the Magento install on your server.

:	1. This can also be the name of your template package. [22%, 55%, sw]
	2. This can also be the name of your template package. [77%, 50%, sw]

Magento uses a hierarchy system. Adding the files in the **base** folder will work with any theme package. You can also elect to add the layout, template, and skin files to your theme package folder (instead of base) in order to have the extension apply only to that theme. Anything placed in the theme package folder will override what exists in the **base** folder. Anything in the **base** folder is accepted as default.

>> If you download a RocketTheme Magento template, the extension files will all be included in the theme package folder, not the base folder.
