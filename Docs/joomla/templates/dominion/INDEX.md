### Fusion Menu

![][fusion]

Fusion is an advanced, CSS menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options, such as text that appears underneath the parent item, called subtext; inline menu images, such as the prebuilt menu icon images, as well as number of columns of child items.

### RTL Support

Template side RTL support from the Fusion menu to the Typography; alongside Gantry's RTL support for the automatic flipping of the grid system. If Joomla is set to RTL mode, in its language settings, the template will automatically adjust to its RTL layout.
