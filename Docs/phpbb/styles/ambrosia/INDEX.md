Introduction
-----

Ambrosia is a contemporary, flat design, ideal for a content-centric forum that features high amount of posts and addons. There is a collection of modules to enhance layout and add custom functionality to your board.

Integrated styling is provided for extensions in its various layout types, such as Tabs and Headlines. Ambrosia is based on the RokBB Framework, and has varying other features available.

>> NOTE: Because Ambrosia is based on a Gantry 5 Joomla template, it is not compatible with RokNavMenu Exporter. This is due to the fact that Gantry 5 does not use RokNavMenu as it has its own built-in menu system. A solution for fans of this exporter is currently in progress.
