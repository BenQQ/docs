Introduction
-----

Entropy is a truly artistic piece, segregating its layout into distinctly designed panes, that are independently styled and configurable. The separated nature of Entropy allows for a visually enticing appearance, as well as catering for a more conservative look.

### Custom Font

![][customfont]

The richness of Entropy is composited in part from its prolific use of custom fonts for varying title elements, ranging from content articles to module titles and textual elements in the various extensions, such as the headers for each pane, providing uniqueness.

### Smooth Scroll

![][scrolling]

The template is outfitted with Smooth Scroll, which adds a smooth animation effect to page anchors. The effect activates when the top button is clicked, smoothly scrolling to the top of the page. It also works for sectional scrolling, as demoed in the 1st level menu items.
