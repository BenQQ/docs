Introduction
-----

Requiem is an exquisitely designed style for the RokBB administration module, offering a fixed side position, for the logo and other elements. Easy to style, configure and customize through an advanced, user friendly and modern interface.

Integrated styling is provided for extensions in its various layout types, such as Tabs and Headlines. Requiem is based on the RokBB Framework, and has varying other features available.

>> NOTE: Because Requiem is based on a Gantry 5 Joomla template, it is not compatible with RokNavMenu Exporter. This is due to the fact that Gantry 5 does not use RokNavMenu as it has its own built-in menu system. A solution for fans of this exporter is currently in progress.

## FixedSide

The FixedSide position is similar to offcanvas, by allowing you to position blocks outside of the main wrapper of the style. For Requiem, FixedSide contains the logo and social icons, but can be adjusted to use whatever modules you prefer.

## Style Settings

Callisto's pre-built presets are displayed in the Styles tab for you to individually customize and apply. You'll also find an assortment of individual style options, such as text and background colors for the various sections, allowing for easy color changes.
