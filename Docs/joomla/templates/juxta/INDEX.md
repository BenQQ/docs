![][detail]

With each preset, Juxta offers three different detailing levels, for both the background and mainbody styling: High, Medium and Low. This allows you to radically affect the style of the template to better match your intended purpose, such as low for a conservative site.

### RTL Support

Template side RTL support from the Fusion menu to the Typography; alongside Gantry's RTL support for the automatic flipping of the grid system. If Joomla is set to RTL mode, in its language settings, the template will automatically adjust to its RTL layout.
