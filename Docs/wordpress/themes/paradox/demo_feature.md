Feature Section
-----

![](demo_6.png)

The Feature section actually includes three separate **Text** widgets. Because each one takes up 100% width, they are stacked and as such are given a scroller so you can switch between them one at a time.

Here is the widget breakdown for the Feature section:

* Text
* Text
* Text

### Text 1

This section of the page is a standard text widget. You will need to enter the following in the main text field.

~~~ .html
<p class="nomarginbottom">The <strong>Widget Position Scroller</strong> feature places multiple tiers of widgets within the same row, inside a <strong>rotation effect</strong>. Therefore, instead of stacking, the widgets appear through <strong>transition</strong>, either by automatic or manual (via arrows) fade.</p>
~~~

Here is a breakdown of options changes you will want to make to match the demo.

* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

### Text 2

This section of the page is a standard text widget. You will need to enter the following in the main text field.

~~~ .html
<p class="nomarginbottom">Control the scrolling feature on a <strong>per widget row</strong>, and even a per override basis. There are settings to <strong>enable/disable</strong> the feature, as well as set the <strong>duration</strong> time, <strong>animation</strong> effect, <strong>delay</strong> time and <strong>manual/automatic</strong> rotation.</p>

### Text 3

This section of the page is a standard text widget. You will need to enter the following in the main text field.
