Introduction
-----

![][demo]

The MageMenus module replaces the default Magento dropdown with a configurable jQuery based menu. It also gives you the option of having two side menus, one on the left and one on the right, which can also display links of your choice.

>> NOTE:  This extension overrides some core Magento files - if you have multiple store views, and do not wish to use the extension on a particular view, it should be disabled in the config for that store view, by going to **System -> Configuration -> RT RokMage Modules -> MageMenus** and setting **Enable Top Menu** to **No**. 

Top Menu
-----

From the admin configuration, you can set which items will appear in the top menu, and in which order. You have the choice of whether or not to display a 'Home' link, whether or not to include the catalog categories, which CMS pages to include, if any (up to a maximum of 6), and whether or not to include a 'Contact' link. 

You can also specify "child" pages, to be shown in the dropdown sub-menus. These are added as a comma separated list of URL keys (with no spaces or trailing comma) below the main menu item you wish to be the parent. All menu animation settings can be tweaked in the config too.

The options available are as follows:

* **mm_slidedownspeed**: 250 ⇒ Sets the slide down speed of the 2nd level dropdown.
* **mm_fadeoutspeed**: 150 ⇒ Sets the fade out speed of the 2nd level dropdown.
* **mm_css_pre**: {left: 100, opacity: 0 } ⇒ Sets the position of 3rd level dropdown before it is visible.
* **mm_animatein**: {left: 165, opacity: 1} ⇒ Defines the animation for the 3rd level dropdown coming into view.
* **mm_animateout**: {opacity: 0, left: 180} ⇒ Defines the animation for the 3rd level dropdown going out of view.
* **mm_animate_speed**: 200 ⇒ Sets the overal animation speed.
* **mm_pause**: 200 ⇒ Sets the pause before the dropdown menu retreats on mouseout.

Side Menus
-----

If you choose to use the side menus, you have the option of defining your own menu titles, whether or not to include the catalog categories, and which CMS pages, if any, to include (to a maximum of 6). You can also include a 'Contact' link if desired, and can add "child" items in the same manner as for the top menu. These sub-menu items are shown in an accordion fashion. 

Breadcrumbs
-----

Although Magento does not support hierarchal CMS pages, the jQuery script that powers the menus will inject a pages "menu" parent into the site breadcrumbs. Both the top and side menus have this functionality - however, if an item appears in both menus, the top menus parent will take precedence. 

Setup
-----

RokMage Modules can be managed via the configuration interface accessible by navigating to **Admin -> System -> Configuration** and clicking on the corresponding extension in the sidebar under **RokMage Modules**. 

You will want to make sure that the **Configuration Scope** is set to the theme you wish to modify the settings unless you wish to change the default for all scopes.

How to Install
-----

You can download a zip package from the RokMage Extensions using the **Download** button above..

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the extension package, you will notice that the folder structure for the files has been included. This means you can simply copy the files/folders over to the corresponding folder of your Magento site, if developing locally. 

If you are developing on a remote server, you can simply upload the **app** and **skin** folders to the Magento install on your server.

![][installation]

:	1. This can also be the name of your template package. [22%, 55%, sw]
	2. This can also be the name of your template package. [77%, 50%, sw]

Magento uses a hierarchy system. Adding the files in the **base** folder will work with any theme package. You can also elect to add the layout, template, and skin files to your theme package folder (instead of base) in order to have the extension apply only to that theme. Anything placed in the theme package folder will override what exists in the **base** folder. Anything in the **base** folder is accepted as default.

>> If you download a RocketTheme Magento template, the extension files will all be included in the theme package folder, not the base folder.
