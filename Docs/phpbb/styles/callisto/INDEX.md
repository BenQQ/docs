Introduction
-----

Callisto is our first phpBB style to feature the Leafo SCSS compiler. This compiler makes it easier than ever to customize your site and create an environment unique to your forum.

Integrated styling is provided for extensions in its various layout types, such as Tabs and Headlines. Callisto is based on the RokBB Framework, and has varying other features available.

>> NOTE: Because Callisto is based on a Gantry 5 Joomla template, it is not compatible with RokNavMenu Exporter. This is due to the fact that Gantry 5 does not use RokNavMenu as it has its own built-in menu system.

## SCSS Compiler

Callisto is the first RocketTheme Club phpBB style to be released with Leafo SCSS Compiler. SCSS is a CSS preprocessor that adds many features like variables, mixins, imports, color manipulation, functions, and tons of other powerful features.

## Style Settings

Callisto's pre-built presets are displayed in the Styles tab for you to individually customize and apply. You'll also find an assortment of individual style options, such as text and background colors for the various sections, allowing for easy color changes.

## Gmail-style Avatars

Callisto contains improved main forum layout. Layout is based on user avatars and customizable containers. It shows last user avatar image instead forum icon or first topic/forum letter. It also adds status indicator which notifies on new topics or special actions.
