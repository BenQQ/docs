No, Citadel is only compatible with WordPress 3.4+.

## What is RokSprocket?

[RokSprocket][roksprocket] is a powerful content display extension for WordPress 3.x. It was designed as the successor to our legacy content extensions: RokStories, RokTabs, RokNewsPager, RokNewsflash, RokMicronews, and basically any module in the RT arsenal that manipulates and displays articles.

## What is Gantry?

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme theme. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of WordPress.

## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing WordPress! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both WordPress and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh WordPress! installation.

## I installed Citadel RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
