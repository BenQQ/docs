### Color Chooser

![][color]

The Color Chooser is an interactive popup that allows you to edit the various style elements of Crystalline, such as background, text, link colour and overlay graphics, live. The transparent nature of the style perfectly complements this feature.

### Module Style

![][style]

There are 14 suffixes: bg1-5, title1-5, flush, flushtop, flushbottom & basic, a mix of stylistic suffixes, to adjust title/bg style and color, as well as structural suffixes. Module Variations allow for the individual styling of each module within a position, without it being global.

### Fusion Menu

Fusion is an advanced, CSS menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options, such as text that appears underneath the parent item, called subtext; inline menu images, such as the prebuilt menu icon images, as well as column number.
